## How to run project

1. Open project in VSCode (for example)
2. Run command `npm i` in terminal (console) for installing all required packages (Node.js is required: <https://nodejs.org/en/>)
3. For building project you can use the following commands:
   - `npm run build-prod` - building production version (minimized and optimized). The project will be builded into `build` folder. You can change destination in `webpack.common.js (line 19)`
   - `npm run build-dev` - building development version
   - `npm run serve` - building development hot-reloaded version with webpack-dev-server

## How to re-use project

1. In the header of this repo located button  `Use this template ðŸ“—` (in top-right corner). Click on the button and select **Create a new repository**
2. Clone created repository to local disk and in console add branches from template repo
  - `git remote add template https://github.com/Yegorich555/webpack-must-have`
  - `git fetch --all`
3. Great. Now you have repo tied with template-repo :)

## TODO

- Add icomoon to fonts
- Path autocomplete doesn't read path-alias-config from tsconfig.json

## Troubleshooting

- Impossible to install anything with `npm i`
  > check if your NodeJS version matches with pointed in **package.json: engines.node** section (use [NVM](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) to easy manage NodeJS versions)
- Impossible to run scripts from package.json
  > try to change backslashes (npm-cli issue that flows between versions time to time)
  > from `.\\node_modules\\.bin\\webpack serve --open --config webpack.devServer.js"`
  > to `./node_modules/.bin/webpack serve --open --config webpack.devServer.js"`
